# Weather Dashboard
## About the Project
This browser-based weather dashboard was built with vanilla JavaScript, CSS, HTML and the [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/) as an exercise in using server-side APIs. 

The application features a current weather display, five-day forecast and persistent search history with local storage.
